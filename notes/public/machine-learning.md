# Machine Learning


## What is Machine Learning?

1959 - Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

1998 - A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.


## Kinds of Learning

Supervised - given a dataset where right answers were known

 * Regression - predict continuous valued output

   * linear regression

    * with one variable - univariate

    * multiple variables - multivariate

    * hypotheses, cost function and its minimization

   * gradient descent algorithm; convex function; batch gradient descent

   * normal equation

 * classification - discreete valued output

Unsupervised
